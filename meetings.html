        <h2>Meeting 2: September 13th</h2>
        <h3>Agenda</h3>
        <p>
            We will be meeting Thursday, September 13th in the lobby of Milner before we head up to the third floor and start working on the project. Each group member should have at least two ideas of organizations they would like to work with and each member should
            bring ideas on how we can fundraise for these organizations. The main objective of this meeting will be to narrow down our organization to 1 or 2 so that we can start contacting them and get information on what we will need to do for the project
            for the rest of this semester.</p>
        <h3>Minutes</h3>
        <p>The attendees of the meeting were as follows: Minette, Jon, Derek, Joe, Sean and Zach. Everyone there was on time and ready to get to work. Sam has not contacted us about being within the group and did not show up to the meeting today. It is safe
            to say that they have ghosted us and should not be in our group any longer. The meeting took place Thursday, September 13th at 4:55pm and ended at 5:46pm. We have switched up roles within the group this meeting. Minette, the Historian, plans
            on taking photos of important points when they are needed. Zach, the Recorder, plans on keeping everyone up to date on what everyone is doing and I plan to keep a log of what everyone decides to do. Derek, the Webmaster, plans to manage and
            maintain the group website and other technical stuff our group decides on doing. Sean and Joe, the two Treasurers, plan to keep a log of the products we raise and to make sure these numbers are organized and transparent with the group. Jon,
            the Liason, plans to communicate with the organizations and teacher when he needs to. The objective of this meeting was to decide on an organization to work with and prepare our proposal for next week. We did this and narrowed our organizations
            down to Wishbone, Home Sweet Home or the Humane Society.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>An outline for the meeting:</p>
        <p>First, we reintroduced ourselves to one another and met Derek for the first time. Derek took over the role of Webmaster from Joe who is now the second Treasurer. We then decided on which organizations most interested us and narrowed the selections
            down to (#1)Wishbone, (#2)Home Sweet Home, (#3)The Humane Society. We then decided on three SMART goals which were the primary objective of $100/person, finish before/by Early Submission deadline and to figure out the organizations needs.
            We finally conversed about where we will meet every week.</p>

        <p>What each member needs to achieve for the next meeting:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Zach: Create an agenda</p>
            </li>
            <li>

        <h3>Minutes</h3>    
        <p> The attendees of the meeting were as follows: Minette, Jon, Derek, Joe, Sean, Sam, and Zach. Everyone there was on time and ready to get to work. We finally met Sam on Tuesday and are glad we get to work with him on the project. The ties have not been cut and I and the others feel he is a great fit for our group. The meeting took place Thursday, September 20th at 4:55pm and ended at 5:41pm. We had to decide a role for Sam and we decided with the experience he has working with companies that he would be a great fit for a second Liaison position. According to the previous minutes, I was supposed to create the next agenda for out meeting which I did. Minette was to gather information from Jon about what companies we would be working with which we have since decided we would like to work with MidWest Food Bank. Jon was supposed to gather information from the companies but since we decided to switch up the company, him and Sam need to contact the organization and see what they need in terms of donations/volunteer work. Joe and Sean were to keep track of any donor information/volunteer logs which didnâ€™t happen since Sean contacted a warehouse and they said the donations needed to go through the actual organization and not us. Derek was to create the base for the group site which he did and he plans to keep it updated as the group moves forward. The objective of the meeting was to get the proposal finished which did not happen, but it should be finished by tonight. We also decided we would prefer to work with the MidWest Food Bank if possible.
</p>

<p> An outline for the meeting:</p>

<p> First, we decided what role Sam would take on within the group by listening to his ideas for the group project. After his talking, we decided a second Liaison would be perfect for him because of the experience he has working with different organizations. We then talked about what organization we would like to work with and this was MidWest Food Bank. After this decision, we looked at the proposal and had a round table discussion on the questions included within the document. We also decided during the meeting that the 5th floor would be better for us to work in rather than the 6th floor.
</p>

<p> What each member needs to achieve for the next meeting:</p>
<ul>
<li> Zach: Record anything that happens within the group and create an agenda for the group to follow during the next meeting.</li>

<li>Minette: Make sure what we claim in the proposal is backed up with evidence and keep taking pictures of anything important within the group.</li>

<li>Jon & Sam: Contact Food Bank about working with them and if any questions come up throughout the week make sure to ask the professor about them.
</li>
<li>Derek: Make sure the information on the website is up to date and add the proposal to the site as well.
</li>
<li>Joe and Sean: Contact companies about donations once we get the ok from MidWest Food Bank to work with them.
 </li>
 </ul>
