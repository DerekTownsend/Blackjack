        <h1>Meetings</h1>
        <h2>Meeting 1: September 13th Minutes</h2>
        <p>The attendees of the meeting were as follows: Minette, Jon, Derek, Joe, Sean and Zach. Everyone there was on time and ready to get to work. Sam has not contacted us about being within the group and did not show up to the meeting today. It is safe to say that they have ghosted us and should not be in our group any longer. The meeting took place Thursday, September 13th at 4:55pm and ended at 5:46pm. We have switched up roles within the group this meeting. Minette, the Historian, plans on taking photos of important points when they are needed. Zach, the Recorder, plans on keeping everyone up to date on what everyone is doing and I plan to keep a log of what everyone decides to do. Derek, the Webmaster, plans to manage and maintain the group website and other technical stuff our group decides on doing. Sean and Joe, the two Treasurers, plan to keep a log of the products we raise and to make sure these numbers are organized and transparent with the group. Jon, the Liason, plans to communicate with the organizations and teacher when he needs to. The objective of this meeting was to decide on an organization to work with and prepare our proposal for next week. We did this and narrowed our organizations down to Wishbone, Home Sweet Home or the Humane Society.&nbsp;</p>
<p>An outline for the meeting:</p>
<p>First, we reintroduced ourselves to one another and met Derek for the first time. Derek took over the role of Webmaster from Joe who is now the second Treasurer. We then decided on which organizations most interested us and narrowed the selections down to (#1)Wishbone, (#2)Home Sweet Home, (#3)The Humane Society. We then decided on three SMART goals which were the primary objective of $100/person, finish before/by Early Submission deadline and to figure out the organizations needs. We finally conversed about where we will meet every week.</p>

<p>What each member needs to achieve for the next meeting:</p>
  <ul>
    <li> <p>Zach: Create an agenda</p></li>
    <li> <p>Minette: Gather evidence of Jon contacting the organizations.</p></li>
    <li> <p>Jon: Contact organizations for their needs</p></li>
    <li> <p>Derek: Create a base for the group site</p></li>
    <li> <p>Joe &amp; Sean: Keep track of any donor info/volunteer logs that come up</p></li>
  </ul>
