        <h2>Meeting 2: September 13th</h2>
        <h3>Agenda</h3>
        <p>
            We will be meeting Thursday, September 13th in the lobby of Milner before we head up to the third floor and start working on the project. Each group member should have at least two ideas of organizations they would like to work with and each member should
            bring ideas on how we can fundraise for these organizations. The main objective of this meeting will be to narrow down our organization to 1 or 2 so that we can start contacting them and get information on what we will need to do for the project
            for the rest of this semester.</p>
        <h3>Minutes</h3>
        <p>The attendees of the meeting were as follows: Minette, Jon, Derek, Joe, Sean and Zach. Everyone there was on time and ready to get to work. Sam has not contacted us about being within the group and did not show up to the meeting today. It is safe
            to say that they have ghosted us and should not be in our group any longer. The meeting took place Thursday, September 13th at 4:55pm and ended at 5:46pm. We have switched up roles within the group this meeting. Minette, the Historian, plans
            on taking photos of important points when they are needed. Zach, the Recorder, plans on keeping everyone up to date on what everyone is doing and I plan to keep a log of what everyone decides to do. Derek, the Webmaster, plans to manage and
            maintain the group website and other technical stuff our group decides on doing. Sean and Joe, the two Treasurers, plan to keep a log of the products we raise and to make sure these numbers are organized and transparent with the group. Jon,
            the Liason, plans to communicate with the organizations and teacher when he needs to. The objective of this meeting was to decide on an organization to work with and prepare our proposal for next week. We did this and narrowed our organizations
            down to Wishbone, Home Sweet Home or the Humane Society.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>An outline for the meeting:</p>
        <p>First, we reintroduced ourselves to one another and met Derek for the first time. Derek took over the role of Webmaster from Joe who is now the second Treasurer. We then decided on which organizations most interested us and narrowed the selections
            down to (#1)Wishbone, (#2)Home Sweet Home, (#3)The Humane Society. We then decided on three SMART goals which were the primary objective of $100/person, finish before/by Early Submission deadline and to figure out the organizations needs.
            We finally conversed about where we will meet every week.</p>

        <p>What each member needs to achieve for the next meeting:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Zach: Create an agenda</p>
            </li>
            <li>

        </ul>
        <h3>Minutes</h3>
        <p> The attendees of the meeting were as follows: Minette, Jon, Derek, Joe, Sean, Sam, and Zach. Everyone there was on time and ready to get to work. We finally met Sam on Tuesday and are glad we get to work with him on the project. The ties have
            not been cut and I and the others feel he is a great fit for our group. The meeting took place Thursday, September 20th at 4:55pm and ended at 5:41pm. We had to decide a role for Sam and we decided with the experience he has working with companies
            that he would be a great fit for a second Liaison position. According to the previous minutes, I was supposed to create the next agenda for out meeting which I did. Minette was to gather information from Jon about what companies we would be
            working with which we have since decided we would like to work with MidWest Food Bank. Jon was supposed to gather information from the companies but since we decided to switch up the company, him and Sam need to contact the organization and
            see what they need in terms of donations/volunteer work. Joe and Sean were to keep track of any donor information/volunteer logs which didn’t happen since Sean contacted a warehouse and they said the donations needed to go through the actual
            organization and not us. Derek was to create the base for the group site which he did and he plans to keep it updated as the group moves forward. The objective of the meeting was to get the proposal finished which did not happen, but it should
            be finished by tonight. We also decided we would prefer to work with the MidWest Food Bank if possible.
        </p>

        <p> An outline for the meeting:</p>

        <p> First, we decided what role Sam would take on within the group by listening to his ideas for the group project. After his talking, we decided a second Liaison would be perfect for him because of the experience he has working with different organizations.
            We then talked about what organization we would like to work with and this was MidWest Food Bank. After this decision, we looked at the proposal and had a round table discussion on the questions included within the document. We also decided
            during the meeting that the 5th floor would be better for us to work in rather than the 6th floor.
        </p>

        <p> What each member needs to achieve for the next meeting:</p>
        <ul>
            <li> Zach: Record anything that happens within the group and create an agenda for the group to follow during the next meeting.</li>

            <li>Minette: Make sure what we claim in the proposal is backed up with evidence and keep taking pictures of anything important within the group.</li>

            <li>Jon & Sam: Contact Food Bank about working with them and if any questions come up throughout the week make sure to ask the professor about them.
            </li>
            <li>Derek: Make sure the information on the website is up to date and add the proposal to the site as well.
            </li>
            <li>Joe and Sean: Contact companies about donations once we get the ok from MidWest Food Bank to work with them.
            </li>

        <p> The attendees of the meeting were as follows: Minette, Jon, Derek, Joe, Sean, Sam, and Zach. Everyone there was on time and ready to get to work. The meeting took place Thursday, September 27th at 5:05pm and ended at 5:31pm. I was to make sure
            we had an agenda for this meeting and to record the information we talked about which I have done. Minette’s job was to make sure she keeps information backed up with evidence which she has done thus far. Jon and Sam were to contact the Food
            Bank which Sam did and got information back to us about the opportunity. Derek is making sure the website is up to date and ready for information about our progress to go up on there as well. Jon and Sean were not able to contact companies
            because we didn't get the ok for the Food Bank yet, but when we do they need to get on that.
        </p>

        <p> An outline for the meeting:</p>
        <p>To start the meeting, Sam talked about how he tried contacting MidWest Food Bank to see what exactly they needed and he informed us of the information he had gathered from doing so. After this conversation, we wanted to know everyone's availability
            over the weekend (Fri-Sun) to see when we could volunteer at the Food Bank. Sam also suggested that we try to volunteer with the Food Bank so we could get some real-life feedback from them while doing so. We are still deciding on a timeline
            for the project because we are not sure when the Food Bank will exactly need us. We also need information on if the Food Bank is a viable option for the semester project. With that, we can further the project along and get started on working
            to achieve our SMART goals.</p>
        <p>What each member needs to achieve for the next meeting:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Zach: Record anything that happens within the group and create an agenda for the group to follow during the next meeting. Also, make sure to include schedule in group chat.
            </li>

            <li>Minette: Take pictures of important events in the group, but also make sure to inform the group on your schedule in the group chat.</li>

            <li>Jon & Sam: Contact MidWest Food Bank about working with them and if any questions come up throughout the week make sure to ask the professor about them. Jon should ask if we are ok doing the MidWest Food Bank or not as well. Also, make sure
                to post a weekend schedule inside the group chat.

            </li>
            <li>Derek: Make sure the information on the website is up to date and add any necessary information that has been shown in this meeting. Send schedule in group chat.

        <h3>Minutes</h3>
        <p> The attendees of the meeting were as follows: Minette, Derek, Joe, Sean, Sam, and Zach. Jon was not at the meeting but he informed us last week that he would not be there. Everyone there was on time and ready to get to work. The meeting took place Thursday, October 4th at 5:00pm and ended at 5:48pm. I was to make sure we had an agenda for this meeting and to record the information we talked about which I have done. Minette’s job was to make sure she keeps information backed up with evidence which she has done thus far. Jon and Sam were to contact the Food Bank and the professor which were done but no information was received from them this week. Derek is making sure the website is up to date and ready for information about our progress to go up on there as well which he has been keeping up on every week. Joe and Sean were not able to contact companies because we didn’t get the ok for the Food Bank yet, but when we do they need to get on that so we can work with stores to try and gather items for the Food Bank.
        </p>

        <p> An outline for the meeting:</p>

        <p>To start the meeting, we talked about ways for everyone to get involved with the project. Minette decided to fill out the interest form so we could get more information. We also talked about starting the base for the PowerPoint so we aren’t trying to do it all at the end of the early-submission due date. Joe and Sean are going to get an excel spreadsheet started to have for future reference as well. We also tried to figure out what ways we could get donations for the Food Bank because we weren’t sure on the ways we could and Joe and Sean will try to gather stores once the Food Bank gives us the ok. Talked with the professor about the project and backup plans if need be. The liaisons(Jon and Sam) need to get the OK from the Food Bank or ask them to forward us to an organization like Home Sweet Home.
        </p>
        <p>What each member needs to achieve for the next meeting:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Zach: Record anything that happens within the group and create an agenda for the group to follow during the next meeting. Also, make sure to get information from the group to be able to plan out the next agenda.
            </li>

            <li>Minette: Take pictures of important events in the group, but also make sure to inform the group on any information you receive from the Food Bank.</li>

            <li>Jon & Sam: Contact MidWest Food Bank about working with them and get the information back to the group. Also, make sure to get the ok from them because we need that so we can start asking stores to get donations.</li>
            <li>Derek: Make sure the information on the website is up to date and add any necessary information that has been shown in this meeting. Also, ask questions about the project related to the website.</li>

We also should go one by one and discuss our issues with how the group project is coming along.

        <h3>Minutes</h3>
        <p>The attendees of the meeting were as follows: Minette, Jon, Derek, Joe, Sean, and Zach. Sam did not contact us, nor inform us after the meeting that he would not be at the meeting. The meeting took place Thursday, October 11th at 5:10pm because we waited to see if Sam would show up and it ended at 5:48pm. I was to make sure we had an agenda for this meeting and to record the information we talked about which I have done. Minette’s job was to make sure she keeps information backed up with evidence which she has done thus far. Minette also contacted our new organization, Home Sweet Home, and scheduled our date to volunteer which was great! Jon and Minette were to contact the Food Bank which they did but they never got an answer back so we changed organizations. Derek is making sure the website is up to date and ready for information about our progress to go up on there as well. He also added the mid-project assessment survey to the portfolio as well.  Joe and Sean were not able to contact companies because we didn’t get the ok for the Food Bank yet, but now since we have a new organization they are going to be contacting people to see what we can do for fundraising. Jon also said he could help find ways to fundraise on campus as well.</p>

        <p>An outline for the meeting:</p>
        <p>To start the meeting, Minette asked everyone if they applied for volunteering at Home Sweet Home which we all said we did besides Sam who was not there. We all then talked about how the project was going and that we all felt as if the project wasn’t going as smoothly as we thought it would. With this, we then completed the Mid-Project Assessment survey together which helped us all solidify what we have done and what we need to get done to reach the goals we set at the beginning of the project. We all then brainstormed ideas on how we could get the fundraising done to match our goals but we also devised a plan for where the first 20 minutes are dedicated to work, 5 minutes for a break, then the rest of the meeting goes on as work until the end of the meeting. This might help us become more focused and on track with the meetings which we all said during the meeting that we need to work on staying on task.</p>
        <p>What each member needs to achieve for the next meeting:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Zach: Record anything that happens within the group and help analyze Jon’s agenda for next week to make sure it is correct and good enough to go off of during the meeting.</li>
            <li>Minette: Take pictures of important events in the group, but also make sure to contact Home Sweet Home about getting more volunteer hours than what we are scheduled for. Also, make sure to see what kind of flyers we can have to hand out around the quad prior to actually fundraising.</li>
            <li>Jon: Create the agenda for the week but also ask your fraternity about how they fundraised on the quad so we can maybe do that as well.</li>
            <li>Sam: Contact companies or important people around campus to see how we can start fundraising to meet our goal.</li>
            <li>Derek: Make sure the information on the website is up to date and add any necessary information that has been shown in this meeting. Also, make sure the portfolio is up to date.</li>
            <li>Joe and Sean: Contact companies and people around campus to get fundraising started. Also, if any transactions occur make sure to get those in the spreadsheet.</li>
