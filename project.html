        <p>The Midwest Food Bank helps alleviate hunger and poverty by assisting the sourcing and distribution food donations to pantries in need, nonprofits and disaster relief. One of their primary goals is to reliably source food donations from places
            where it would simply be thrown out. They aim to eliminate waste and give it to the people that need it the most. They have facilities in Bloomington, Peoria and Morton IL, Indianapolis IN, Peachtree City GA, Fort Myers FL, Gilbert AZ, East
            Africa, and Haiti. They have served over 275 counties across the U.S., as well as extensive efforts in East Africa and Haiti. </p>

        <p>One of their goals is to provide this service without a cost to the food donors or those receiving the food. They help to work with partners such as Caterpillar, Salvation Army, State Farm, and many others. Their partners assist them in being
            able to receive a large amount of donations, as well as those who help in transporting and circulating food to the areas in need. After hurricane Katrina hit in 2005, the Midwest Food Bank partnered with Salvation Army. They have worked in
            Houston, Puerto Rico, and are currently aiding disaster relief efforts from hurricane Florence. In their efforts for the Carolinas, they are providing enough food for families of 4 for about 4 days, as well as common toiletries needed. The
            Midwest Food Bank has their own fleet of semi-trucks that are used for distribution, and volunteers work to organize and pack supplies before they are shipped to the partners they work with. Salvation Army states on their website that as of
            late 2017, both organizations have partnered together to deliver over 275,000 boxes of food for disaster areas. Globally, they have worked with missionaries, clinics, schools, and other organizations in almost 20 countries. They are currently
            working in Kenya, Africa. </p>

        <p>Address a problem or social issue your first choice organization deals with. Where do they need help? Here you will probably need to do some research to help explain the issue (make sure you cite your sources). This should be about 500-700 words.
            * </p>



        <p>Our goal as a group is to find the ways the Midwest Food Bank needs the most help, whether it be keeping food in stock or spending time volunteering to help them achieve their goals. One of their main functions is to receive food donations from
            outside sources. We can help by contacting local businesses, churches, and other organizations that have or could obtain food that can be donated there. By us finding more places to source donations from, we are reducing waste and creating
            avenues for these establishments to look towards when dealing with unused goods. Some places may not be actively donating to a food bank, so being able to potentially locate a few new organizations who are interested in donating allows the
            Midwest Food Bank to ultimately reach and improve the lives of the most people. Increasing available donation resources can greatly aid the main goal of the Midwest Food Bank, which is to provide food for those in need. Any aid we can provide
            to the food bank can help lessen issues like hunger and poverty. </p>

        <p>A food drive is also a potentially beneficial method for being able to source as much food that we can as a group. It might allow us to more efficiently work with individuals to achieve that goal for Midwest Food Bank. It might be difficult to
            set something like this up, but it is something that would help and is a viable option. </p>

        <p>Another way to benefit the Midwest Food Bank would be to volunteer for them. Midwest states on their website that helpful volunteering opportunities include services such as preparing and packing disaster relief boxes, repackaging large quantities
            of goods into smaller portions, and aiding in the distribution of the food to local pantries. For matters like disaster relief, having as many people available to help with packaging, sorting and shipping can be a crucial task that allows
            for those in need to receive what they need in time. Midwest Food Bank is requesting volunteers on their Facebook page to help pack food boxes for hurricane Florence victims, which means we can certainly help -- they are on a tight schedule
            to organize and ship the food and hygiene kits out. Disaster relief requires an organization to work quickly if they are to be effective. According to a WJBC article, the first semi load of food boxes for hurricane Florence relief has been
            shipped out on the morning of September 20th, which included around 1,000 boxes. Future jobs like this will need an ample amount of people so they are successful in meeting their specific deadlines for shipping dates. With volunteer sign-ups
            for the 24th and 27th of this month, they could surely benefit from our help. </p>

        <p>What would your team like to do to help combat this problem / issue? Here is where you connect your plan to fulfilling a need of the organization. * </p>

        <p>Our goal is to help the Midwest Food bank's mission in helping those in disadvantaged positions by either sourcing and providing donations for them or by volunteering to help with their other needs that require work. </p>
</li>

<li>
        <p>What are your three SMART goals? (First goal is $100/person x # of people in your group. The other two are up to you). * </p>

        <p>First, the primary objective of $100/person. </p>

        <p>Second, finish the project before or by Early Submission deadline. </p>

        <p>Third, figure out what the organization specifically needs for us to accomplish so we achieve the equivalent of $100 per person of aid. </p>
</li>

<li>
        <p>What is your plan for achieving these goals? * </p>

        <p>We can volunteer and get donations for them, whether it be helping sort and pack items, a food drive, or finding organizations to help donate. </p>
</li>

<li>
        <p>What is your *rough* timeline for achieving these goals? * </p>

        <p>Our timeline is in relation to the early submission deadline. For example, make sure we are at least halfway done with our goals when we are halfway to the early submission deadline. </p>
</li>

<li>
        <p>What potential problems do you anticipate? * </p>

        <p>We may have issues when working with their timelines, and they may not accept certain donations. Midwest Food Bank only has certain dates for packing and sorting items, so we may need to be flexible. When looking for donations, we may have trouble
            finding enough that are available to do so. Finally, we may have issues with contacting companies, but hopefully we can avoid this. </p>
</li>

<li>
        <p>What is your fallback plan? What is your ";point of no return" date for implementing the fallback plan? (ex: ";if we have not achieved 50% of our goal by midterm, we will switch to Plan B."). * </p>

        <p>We can go to local establishments like churches, maybe hold a food drive. Local boy scouts. High schools, etc. Whatever ratio of donations to volunteered hours we come up with, by October 20th, if we haven't made enough progress we will try another
            approach. </p>
</li>

<li>
        <p>Please list any team members who did NOT participate in creating your project proposal, or contributed very little. A quick explanation of what they did/didn't do would be helpful. This isn't to get anyone in trouble but to verify that everyone
            in the group has had a chance to comment on the plan you're turning in (and if they didn't, why not). * </p>

        <p>Everyone contributed by proposing ideas in the meeting for Sam's position, our top pick for the organization, and finally went over things we could do to help them. We all had the chance to voice our concerns with the specifics of our goals for
            the project.</p>
